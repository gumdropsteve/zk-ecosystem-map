# zk-ecosystem-map
This repo is the home of the ZK ecosystem map, a map of the Zero Knowledge ecosystem!

First published on X in 2024 ([link to thread](https://x.com/gumdropsteve/status/1815402319166464264)), the ZK Ecosystem Map serves to keep a live understanding of projects in the ZK Ecosystem and relevant information like developers, news, roadmaps, tokens, and so on. Winston published [The Definitive Guide to ZK](https://medium.com/dropout-analytics/the-definitive-guide-to-zk-1b91572233ca?sk=abdaa16aa5e1894ae9423a910b7c4d1f) to provide context around what Zero Knowledge is and the ZK Ecosystem Map.

The ZK Ecosystem Map is kept live in Sheets ([link to sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mlwzgkhRI-p8giOtvO5Q7HRZJQ0Yq_ni0_9O1ppxs3k/edit?usp=sharing)) where anyone can leave comments about new projects that should be added or their ideas for the ZK Ecosystem Map.
